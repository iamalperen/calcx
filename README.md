**calcx** is a powerful TypeScript-based library that provides a wide range of mathematical functions. Whether you need to perform basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, or complex financial calculations, calcx has you covered.

## Features

- **Geometry Calculations**: Calculate areas, perimeters, and volumes for various shapes like circles, triangles, rectangles, ellipses, spheres, and cylinders.
- **Algebraic Operations**: Perform factorials, permutations, combinations, and logarithmic calculations with ease.
- **Financial Calculations**: Compute simple and compound interest, as well as exponential growth and decay.
- **Conversion Utilities**: Convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats.
- **Vector Operations**: Calculate distances and centroids for points in a 2D space.

## Installation

You can install calcx via npm:

```bash
npm install calcx
```

Usage
Here‚Äôs how you can use calcx in your project:


```typescript
import calcx from 'calcx';

// Example: Calculate the area of a circle
const radius = 5;
const area = calcx.areaOfCircle(radius);
console.log(`The area of the circle is ${area}`);

// Example: Calculate compound interest
const principal = 1000;
const rate = 0.05;
const timesCompounded = 4;
const years = 2;
const futureValue = calcx.compoundInterest(principal, rate, timesCompounded, years);
console.log(`The future value is ${futureValue}`);
```
